# Welcome to the GeckoShop

These instructions go with my stream at [twitch.tv/brassgecko](twitch.tv/brassgecko) and explain how to use 
[Twitch Toolkit](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1718525787) in order to help or harm 
the colony. If anything's confusing, wrong, or broken please say so in the chat!


## What does Twitch Toolkit do?

Toolkit lets you get your grubby fingers into the colony's business. [Commands]({{- "/commands" | relative_url -}}) are
the ways you can use toolkit. The [store]({{- "/" | relative_url -}}) is your list of all items or events available,
their prices, and any karma effects (see the Karma section below!). Send a pawn to join the chaos and customize
their traits and gear, send resources to help build, send raiders to try to burn everything..

Some useful shortcuts if you have purchased a colonist, to save time and avoid me becoming confused:
- `$wear itemName` to instantly wear armor or clothing
- `$equip itemName` to instantly equip a weapon
- `$use itemName` to instantly use food (might not fill hunger) or other consumables 
- `$backpack itemName` to put things in your colonist inventory
- `$surgery itemName` to buy a body mod and queue the operation

## What Are Coins?

Coins are the mod's currency, earned each minute while watching. You can view your balance by using the `{{ bal }}` command. 
{% if utils == true %}
- ðŸ’° represents the amount of coins you current have.
- âš– represents your current karma.
- ðŸ“ˆ represents the amount of coins you gain everytime the mod awards coins.
- ðŸ“‰ represents the amount of coins you lose everytime to mod awards coins.

{% endif %}


{%- if lootboxes == true -%}
My bot will also pester you about lootboxes. Check if you have one by typing `!lootboxes` and open
one with `!openlootbox`
{%- endif -%}

## What is Karma?

Karma is a system that adjusts the number of coins you earn. Higher karma, more coins! Beneficial events 
will raise your karma, harmful events will lower it, and anything neutral -may- raise your karma, 
depending on my settings for the current scenario. BE WARNED! Your karma CAN go negative to the point 
that it begins draining your coins away, at which point you rely on my mercy or the generosity of other 
viewers for a chance to recover. Plan your evils carefully!

## What is Puppeteer?

[Puppeteer](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2057192142) is a mod by Brrainz that
allows viewers to directly control their pawns, and even view a number of information about your pawn in
a graphical way. It also redirects some of the responses from Twitch Toolkit to its website to clean up
chat a bit. So, if you're logged into Puppeeter and you're wondering why the bot isn't responding to you,
you should check the `TT` tab on the website first.
